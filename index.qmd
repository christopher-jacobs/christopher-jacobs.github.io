## About Me

My name is Christopher Jacobs, and I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Clemson University](https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/computing/), advised by [Dr. Eric Patterson](https://people.computing.clemson.edu/~ekp/index.html) and currently based at Clemson's [Charleston Innovation Campus](https://www.clemson.edu/innovation-campuses/charleston/). My area of interest is within visual computing, with a focus on neural rendering techniques, facial analysis, and material capture.

I bring a unique perspective to computer graphics research, combining my computer science background with creative expertise from my master’s in [Digital Production Arts](https://www.cs.clemson.edu/dpa). My goal is to bridge cutting-edge research with real-world applications, particularly in digital media production.

I was originally drawn to computer graphics through my fascination with game and animation production pipelines, and I am now motivated by the opportunity to develop new tools and pioneer technologies that others will build upon. I thrive in collaborative environments, typically approaching problems from a big-picture perspective before diving into more iterative refinements.

I like to balance my research with hobbies such as cooking, gardening, and staying active through weightlifting and running. I am always interested in connecting with fellow researchers and industry professionals working in related areas. You can reach me through email [here](mailto:chejac2000@gmail.com).
